Udham Singh (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was an Indian revolutionary best known for assassinating Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab in British India, on 13th March 1940. The assassination has been excused as an avenging act for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in 1919.[1] Singh was subsequently tried and convicted of murder and hanged in July 1940.<br>

Udham Singh is a well-known figure of the Indian independence movement. He is sometimes referred to as Shaheed-i-Azam Sardar Udham Singh (the expression "Shaheed-i-Azam," Urdu: ???? ?????, means "the great martyr"). A district (Udham Singh Nagar) of Uttarakhand was named after him to pay homage in October 1995 by the then Mayawati government.[2]<br><br>
